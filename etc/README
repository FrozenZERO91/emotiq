We need to have two branches, determined at runtime, to differentiate between Emotiq development and building a binary.

Building a binary is referred to as "Production".

This process must also gel with Travis CI, which rebuilds the whole system (inside of Travis) on every invocation of Travis CI testing.


Development:

As a first step, we need to snip all ties with non-standard libraries, e.g. /usr/local/lib/libpbc.dylib and /usr/local/lib/libgmp.dylib.

A script targeted at development is called emotiq/etc/build-crypto-pairing.bash .  Normal Emotiq developers need to wipe the emotiq/var/local directory (if present) with a command such as 'rm -rf emotiq/var".  Then, run the developers' script on the command-line as "bash build-crypto-pairing.bash".  This creates the directory "emotiq/var" and puts pbc related .h files into "emotiq/var/local/include/pbc" and pbc and gmp dylibs (.dylib on mac, .so on linux) into emotiq/var/locl/lib.

The script takes quite a while to run and displays many lines of config and build messages.

The build is only necessary for developers using the crypto-pairing libraries (PBC and GMP).

For development, this script needs to be run only once, and the var directory structure is retained.

Developers need to load these systems: emotiq, emotiq/delivery, emotiq/utilities, emotiq/blockchain and emotiq/startup.

Developers should run (emotiq:main) to "run" the system.  The code to run a blockchain node are installed by modifying the function "main" in the file startup.lisp.

Building a binary:

Building a binary (which is something developers will rarely do) is performed by another script.  The steps are:

1) Delete the emotiq/var directory (e.g. "rm -rf emotiq/var")
2) Cd into emotiq/etc.
3) Run the delivery script, e.g. "bash production.bash".

This script also runs for a long time and displays many messages.

This script results in:
- a script emotiq.bash
- a binary called emotiq
- a DLL called libLispPBCIntf.{dylib,.so}
- DLLs called libpbc.{dylib,.so}.*
- DLLs called libgmp.{dylib,.so}.*

The resulting files are all placed in one directory emotiq/var/local/production-{linux,mac}.

The listed files can be copied (or tar'ed) to another machine, into an empty directory.

The binary is run by "bash emotiq.bash".  Certain older Mac's fail with a register dump in libgmp.

The binary always calls the Lisp function "start".

The above works with LispWorks development, and the processes may change as we branch out to use other lisps.
