to build and run:

> (ql:quickload :emotiq/node)
> (emotiq:node)

You should see an "emotiq>" prompt, at which you can type 'help'.



To get the simulator to work on a single machine:

change the IP address in node-sim.lisp

> (ql:quickload :emotiq/sim)
> (cosi-simgen:node) ;; which defaults to the *top-node* being 127.0.0.1
or
> (cosi-simgen:node "192.168.2.13") ;; (replace the string with your IP address) *top-node* becomes the specified string

On LispWorks, open an Output-Browser to see the output.  Other lisps, the output ends up
being displayed where PRINT displays.
