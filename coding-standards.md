# Coding Standards
## Directory Structure
All source code will be in `/src`.
## Unit Tests
Write unit tests for all code whenever possible. Place in /src/tests directory.
We'll use [Lisp-Unit](htps://github.com/OdonataResearchLLC/lisp-unit) for testing.
## ASDF

`ASDF3` ships with Allegro 10.1 currently as `asdf-3.2.0`.
    
`ASDF3` upgrades fine from [ASDF](git+https://gitlab.common-lisp.net/asdf/asdf/)
currently `asdf-3.3.1`.
    
## Quicklisp 

Probably best to test with latest, currently `Quicklisp 2018-01-31`.

Notable Quicklisp systems include IRONCLAD, for which we currently
depend upon for our crypto.
